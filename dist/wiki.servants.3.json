Within her body burns the fire of a malignant god who dwells in the stars...\n\n\n\"I offer my beauty to my nation, my love to His Imperial Majesty, and my heart to my blood relatives. However, my pipa's melody...the joy of singing and dancing...is the only thing I shall keep for myself.\""],

She also dearly loves hot springs and lychee. She is straightforward and positive. She works hard and takes joy in serving those with whom she is intimate.\n\n\nDuring the three hundred years of the Tang Dynasty's rule, she became a concubine to Emperor Xuanzong at the dynasty's height. Xuanzong was the grandson of Wu Zetian, making her Yang Guifei's grandmother-in-law...at least that is their technical relationship, but mention that at your peril."],

The \"Rainbow Feathered Robe\" passage was said to have been commissioned by Xuanzong for Yang Guifei. The poem was later forbidden for its symbolism of ruinous beauty, and its musical scores have been scattered and lost.\n\n\nYang Guifei became a Taoist nun before she was taken in as an imperial consort, and during that time she was trained under the Taoist Luo Gongyuan to ultimately gain the title \"Taizhen.\" Her soul became that of a sage after her death, and it is said that she continues to wait to reunite with her beloved emperor.\n\n\nThe star from the abyss chants a song that doesn't reach the ears of the common people."],

Her body buried in the residential area on the outskirt of the city was later dug up, but they never found it.\n\n───That's right. Yang Guifei's karma of ruin and devilish beauty drew the attention of an evil god from outer space and it beckoned her soul. The many legends left to posterity had also become a source of power for the Servant, Yang Guifei.\n\nYang Guifei, who became a fighter, would serve her Master with all her heart. There is definitely no deception in that.\n\nHowever, there is only a paper thin difference between what good she does and madness. Whether the Shangdi reflected in her eyes is the soul of the emperor or perhaps the firelight of destruction that will turn everything to ashes; never let your guard down and watch out for the schemes of the devil lurking in the void."]
