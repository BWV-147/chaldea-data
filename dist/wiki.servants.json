Still, the resulting golems are about as powerful as an E-rank Servant, and can be manufactured endlessly as long as the budget permits.\n\nHowever, Avicebron can summon golems of his own accord in battle, though these can only be used temporarily, and are not especially durable."],

That should, however, be both expected and understandable if you accept the fact that he would readily trample anyone in service of fulfilling his dream.\n\n\nHe was a sickly man during his lifetime, particularly prone to skin infections. In consequence, he was said to have been dour and pessimistic. His refusal to take off his mask and reveal his face reflects that particular quality. Historically, Avicebron is said to have passed down his philosophical teachings from Arabia to Europe. It may not even be a stretch to say that he was one of the first to begin the Renaissance.\n\n\nHe also coined the term Kabbalah, which is derived from the Hebrew word for \"receive.\" Legend has it that he created a female golem to do housework for him."]

The poem was later forbidden for its symbolism of ruinous beauty, and its musical scores have been scattered and lost.\n\n\nYang Guifei became a Taoist nun before she was taken in as an imperial consort, and during that time she was trained under the Taoist Luo Gongyuan to ultimately gain the title \"Taizhen.\" Her soul became that of a sage after her death, and it is said that she continues to wait to reunite with her beloved emperor.\n\n\nThe star from the abyss chants a song that doesn't reach the ears of the common people."],

Yang Guifei's karma of ruin and devilish beauty drew the attention of an evil god from outer space and it beckoned her soul. The many legends left to posterity had also become a source of power for the Servant, Yang Guifei.\n\nYang Guifei, who became a fighter, would serve her Master with all her heart. There is definitely no deception in that.\n\nHowever, there is only a paper thin difference between what good she does and madness. Whether the Shangdi reflected in her eyes is the soul of the emperor or perhaps the firelight of destruction that will turn everything to ashes; never let your guard down and watch out for the schemes of the devil lurking in the void."]

She made the plan to throw away her memories while becoming her Lily form, only remembering her name. This is why, while she was Lily, she believed herself to be a Yaobikuni Pseudo-Servant.\n\n\nThe normal Kiara returned to the lake to get her revenge on Xu Fu, hid her true self there, and adapted her fun to the rules of the Death Game Xu Fu set up.

If he is so inclined, he can live like that and have that be his true persona.\n\nHowever, since he is cursed and anything he does is considered a lie, it being true holds no meaning to it.\n\n\nHe will never harbor love for any living thing, any human.\n\nTo Oberon, humans and faeries alike are targets of exclusion that are unimportant but unpleasant, disgusting but appear happy.\n\nSince Oberon can never feel happiness all his life, he considers other lifeforms that can achieve happiness just by being alive without any effort or intelligence to be an eyesore and incomprehensible to him."],

In order to honour the request of her friend, Muryan, who she met in the Sixth Lostbelt, which was “Please, protect Britain”, she successfully protected “the only ones who could possibly save Britain, Chaldea (the Storm Border)” from the Hands of the Festival God Cernunnos, and immediately after that, Oberon’s plan to inject the amassed “Stagnation” of Cernunnos caused her Spirit Origin to enlarge. Unable to control her own power anymore, she retreated from the Sixth Lostbelt.\n\nAfter that, in a rampaging state, Koyanskaya retreated to the “Non-Primate Biosphere” that had been developing and hiding on the Blank Slate Earth, and unwillingly began her eclosion (it was too early, but she had no choice).\n\n\n◆\n\n\nAlthough she materialized as an Evil of Humanity, from the beginning to the end, she remained immature, and never became a calamity against humanity (As the Beast of Treasuring, she chose not to attack humanity directly out of pride), thus, she bears no inscription as a Beast.\n\n\nWith that as her conclusion, she was denied the Class.\n\nThe name of the country-ruining lady was a lie.\n\nShe was a biosphere that could not discard humanity, and now continues to move with Human History.\n\nHer name is Beast IV: Lost.\n\n\nWhile trying to become one of the Seven Evils of Humanity, she was a Beast who carried the principle of “Treasuring”."]
